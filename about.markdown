<center>Hey there! I am an easygoing person with an enormous love for science and research. I graduated with my Master's degree from the University of Helsinki, with my work focusing on theoretical quantum physics, statistical methods, and astrophysics. Since graduating, I worked as an IT Consultant trainee, where I focused on data engineering (Azure), data analysis (Python, MATLAB, Tableau), and machine learning (PyTorch, Tensorflow). I am passionate about studying theoretical physics and making innovative, sustainable technological advancements in areas like quantum computing, data engineering and analysis, and AI. It is important to understand and be involved in the advancement of science and technology so that it can progress responsibly and help to pave a better future for the planet we're living on.</center>

## On this website

During my time at University, I worked on several projects that focus on Statistical methods for physics, which are essentially the fundamental techniques used in more robust Data Analysis projects. I found these to be really cool and enjoyable to work on, and they played a big role in me deciding what I wanted to do after graduating. Since then, I decided to put these skills to work and complete some "real" Data Analysis projects. Not only did I get to fill in the gaps of my knowledge with statistics and data visualisation, but I learned what it takes to creatively think about issues that companies face and turn them into stories. By telling these stories, I get to solve something impactful and make the whole process easy for others to understand. 

On this website, you caan find the Projects I have completed so far, with more to come! While I am still at the very early stages of my professional career, I hope you can track my progress more easily through this website and see what I am capable of, as well as the things I still need to learn.
